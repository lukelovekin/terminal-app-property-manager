## Statement of purpose and scope

The "Propery Manager Terminal App" will allow both Landlords and Tenants to manage their rentals without the use of a property manager therefor saving the Landlord management fees between 6-9% of thier weekly rent income. Using this app the Tenant will be able moneouvre their way through their terminal nd following the options and prompts to store and access infomation such as entry and exit reports, tenancy agreements, when rent is due and how much, send maintanence requests etc.

The property manager app will help Landlord organise and manage and store their property/ies and there details such as new and existing entry/exit reports, tenancy agreements, quartely inspections, admin checklists, and advertising functions such as advertising checklist on getting on the market, inspectons calender, and inspections feedback. The Landlord can also access their ingoing and outgoing expenses, maintenence requests and net balances and more

I am developing this app to do the job a property manager and manage my own property because as a Landlord myself, I would like an easier way to manage my property/ies without havign to pay $58 weekly, thats over $3000 a year for something i can manage through my terminal

Target audience for this app definitley be all home owners looking to save on management fees and even tenants alike who would rather not deal with property managers 

By cloning the git and installing the requiremtns and gems etc and following the steps below!??!? and running the program through their terminal and following the options and prompts
EXPAND ON HOW THE AUDIENCE WILL USE(USAGE GUIDE,INSTALLATION GUIDE step by step processes)(ANOTHER HEADING FOR MOTIVATION?????????? CHECK OTHER GITHUBS)

## Applications features and how they work

- Easy to use/follow organization. 
With the use of helpful output prompts and case statements that allow for all intputs to be handled, whether valid input was entered or not, to either direct them to their next page or give them another prompt on what to do.

- Store and Read text to and from a csv file
Using the appropriate gem with its required methods and  block of code to execute, the user is able to make maintenance requests and store text into a csv

- Landlord and seperate Tenant side of the application
Using loops and conditional control structures and with input from the user they can be directed to their side of the application and directed to where they want to go with the loops implemented to keep them from entering anything other than valid input


- use of variables and the concept of variable scope

- error handling
Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .	300 words (approx. 100 words per feature)

## User interaction and experience

- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user
After running the app in the terminal the user will greeted with the app logo and a home screen choose whether they are a tenant or a landlord, they will be then directed to their next home screen where there will be options and helpful information and prompts displayed of which they can input using their keyboard to go to where they wouldlike to go. The user will not be left without options and the chance to input any given time, making interaction and navigation clear and easy to use. Any non self explanatory options or terminoloy will be displayed on each page. at any stage when the user is finished they can exit the application. Most of the users interaction will be entering options dispolayed on screen otherwise further input instructions will be explain where they need to be. If at any point the users input is invalid the application will (show its most recent options menu until correct input is entered or until user exits) (?following the exit options?)(EXPAND)
