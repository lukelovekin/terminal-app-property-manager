README DOCS
R1	Answers to all the documentation requirements below.	



R2	Your README.md should have a separate heading for each 
documentation requirement and answers organised under the appropriate headings.	 



R3	Provide full attribution to referenced sources (where applicable).	



R4	Provide a link to your source control repository	 
 	Design a Software Development Plan for a terminal application. The following requirements provide details of what needs to be included in this plan,



R5	Develop a statement of purpose and scope for your application. It must include:
- describe at a high level what the application will do
- identify the problem it will solve and explain why you are developing it
- identify the target audience
- explain how a member of the target audience will use it
-300 - 500 words



R6	Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature
Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling
Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .	300 words (approx. 100 words per feature)



R7	Develop an outline of the user interaction and experience for the application.
Your outline must include:
- how the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature
- how the user will interact with / use each feature
- how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user	 



R8	Develop a diagram which describes the control flow of your application. Your diagram must:
- show the workflow/logic and/or integration of the features in your application for each feature.
- utilise a recognised format or set of conventions for a control flow diagram, such as UML.



R9	Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.	



R10	Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:
- steps to install the application
- any dependencies required by the application to operate
- any system/hardware requirements

Slide deck

R11	An overview of your Terminal application
	The main features and overall structure of your app


R12	An overview of your code	
An explanation of the important parts of your code
What I learnt
Anything id do differently

---------------------------------------------------------------

R13	Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Ruby such as:
- variables and variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- write and utilise simple functions
- error handling
- input and output
- importing a Ruby Gem
- using functions from a Ruby Gem



R14	Apply DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.



R15	Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.



R16	Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.



R17	Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application



R18	Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:
- making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes
- pushing all commits to a remote repository



R19	Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:
For example,
- writing a script which turns the application into an executable; OR
- packaging the application for use as a module or dependency
